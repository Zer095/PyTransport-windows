\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the base model interface and related functions for inflationary cosmology. 

This header file contains the declaration of the {\ttfamily model} class, which encapsulates the defining features of an inflationary model, including the flow tensors (u1, u2, u3) and the action-\/related tensors (A, B, C). It also provides methods for calculating cosmological parameters like the Hubble rate (H), slow-\/roll parameters (epsilon, eta), and gauge transformation tensors (N1, N2).

The class interacts with the {\ttfamily potential} class to retrieve potential values and their derivatives.
